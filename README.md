# @cogpsybot (Twitter)

This bot scrapes different websites for new releases in journal articles. Currently, we are scraping from:
- Cognitive Psychology
- Acta Psychologica
- Brain and Cognition
- Cognition
- Consciousness and Cognition
- Journal of Memory and Language
- Neuropsychologica
- Trends in Cognitive Sciences

We will be adding to the list as the code becomes more complex. Target journal companies include Elsevier, Taylor and Francis, and Routeledge.

The cogpsybot is the first iteration of a series of Twitterbots dedicated to mining journal websites and directly related to @cogagingbot and @quantpsybot.
