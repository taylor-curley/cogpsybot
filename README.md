This bot scrapes different websites for new releases in journal articles related to Cognitive Psychology. Currently, we are scraping from:
- Cognitive Psychology
- Acta Psychologica
- Brain and Cognition
- Cognition
- Consciousness and Cognition
- Journal of Memory and Language
- Neuropsychologica
- Trends in Cognitive Sciences
- Applied Research in Memory and Cognition
- Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society
- Memory & Cognition
- Learning & Behavior

We will be adding to the list as the code becomes more complex. Target journal companies include Elsevier, Taylor and Francis, Springer, and Routeledge.

The cogpsybot is the first iteration of a series of Twitterbots dedicated to mining journal websites and is directly related to @cogagingbot and @quantpsybot.
